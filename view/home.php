                And an aspiring future SWE

            <p>
                I'm currently a student at the University of Memphis, where I'm <br>
                diving deep into the world of software engineering! I decided to <br>
                create my first ever portfolio website, so here it is, enjoy!

            <h2>How It Started</h2>
            <p>
                I developed a passion for technology from an early age
                when my cousins introduced me to PSPs and various older
                gaming consoles! Eventually I started learning how to root,
                jailbreak, and modify code in various devices and video games
                that I would enjoy playing such as Minecraft, Mega Man and Halo. Technology 
                has played a huge role in my upbringing, therefore, I decided to 
                pursue a degree in a field that encompasses my passion.
