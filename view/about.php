            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                Hello! I’m Christopher Valle, a dedicated student at the University of Memphis, where I’m pursuing a Bachelor’s in Computer Science within the ABM program.<br>
                My passion for software engineering and technology has been a driving force in my life, fueled by my early exposure to classic video games like Halo Reach, Call of Duty, and Mega Man.<br><br>

                Born and raised in Memphis, I’ve always been captivated by the innovative potential of technology.
                After completing my Bachelor’s degree, I plan to embark on a job search while continuing my education with a Master’s degree.<br><br>

                In my free time, you’ll often find me exercising, which not only keeps me fit but also inspires my work with fresh perspectives.
                I also enjoy tackling LeetCode problems and starting personal projects, constantly seeking to enhance my skills.
                I believe in the power of creativity and collaboration, striving to develop user-friendly applications that resonate with users and enhance their experiences.<br><br>

                I’m always eager to connect with fellow creatives and professionals.
                Feel free to reach out to me at crvalle85@gmail.com or through any of my socials!<br><br>
                Thank you for visiting my portfolio!
